 Description This project implements a real-time video authentication system using DeepFace for face recognition and anti-spoofing techniques. The user is provided with a login page, after which they can upload video files for analysis. The application analyzes the uploaded video to determine whether the faces in the video are real or fake, and displays the results in a table along with progress updates. The app uses PyQt for the user interface and utilizes DeepFace for deep learning-based face analysis, specifically focusing on real-time video processing. The system provides feedback through a progress bar and a dynamic table, offering an interactive and informative user experience.  Key Features:  Login page: User authentication with basic username and password validation. File Upload: Upload video files for face authentication analysis. Real-Time Progress: Progress bar updates during video analysis. DeepFace Integration: Utilizes the DeepFace library for face recognition and anti-spoofing detection. Dynamic Table: Displays file information and status updates for each uploaded video. Stop Functionality: Option to stop the analysis process midway. Error Handling: Clear error messages if something goes wrong during the analysis. Notes This project is meant for demonstrating real-time face recognition in video files, detecting whether faces in the video are real or fake using DeepFace's face recognition model with anti-spoofing techniques enabled. It is built using Python, PyQt5 for the graphical interface, and the DeepFace library for facial analysis. The app processes video files, displaying analysis progress with a visual interface.  Future Work: Expand the application to support more models for face recognition. Improve video processing efficiency. Enhance the user interface with more interactive features like drag-and-drop for file uploads.
